Database Setup
-----------------------------
In the Directory with the reviews.sql file:
    1. createdb -U postgres reviews
    2. psql -U postgres -d reviews -f reviews.sql



Java Project
-----------------------------
1. Added postgresql driver to pom.xml
2. Replaced the existing Mock Dao classes with ones that connect to the Database
3. Added DataSource Bean definition to springmvc-servlet.xml
4. Updated the ProductReview JSON Annotation to a correct Data Format that is allowed by it's data type.  
    This value was hardcoded until it needed to be pulled from the database - integration testing revealed the error.



Product Reviews (Vue.js App)
-----------------------------
1. Update the API_URL
    API_URL: "http://localhost:8080/product-reviews-api-with-database/api/reviews"
