# REST API Lecture

During lecture today you will be building out a product reviews application. The product at the top of the page is a Tech Elevator Yeti. On the same page you will list out a number of reviews. These reviews will come from a mockAPI and you will have the ability to list, create, read, update, and delete. During lecture you will be building out all of the REST API calls that perform those actions.
